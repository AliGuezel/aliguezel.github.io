    <h1>Cybersecurity Challenges in Aviation</h1>

    <p>
        Cyber-technologies have become an integral part of the aviation ecosystem, which also extend to the whole system of avionics, air-traffic controls, airlines, and airports . The impacts range from improving on the ground, air-borne or in-space operations, customer services; such as but not limited to ticket bookings, in-flight entertainments system, flights checking in and out, security screening of passengers, and use of aircraft cabin wireless network internet services.It is also of no doubt that these technologies have been of great positive impacts to the aviation control systems, provided better aviation operations, safety, and performance  but attackers make use of vulnerabilities in these systems.

        Advancements in cyber-attack tools and methods as well as the increased exposures and motivation of the attackers have led to the current trend in these cyber-attacks thus affecting airlines, aircraft manufacturers and authorities.
        Cybersecurity vulnerability in aviation means that errors in flight-related computer-based systems or affected systems compromise network and information security. The vulnerability provides an entry point or gateway to exploit a system and therefore poses potentially serious security risks. Any system connected to the Internet is likely to be attacked by "hackers". Therefore, it is extremely important for an organization to manage the risk of cyber attacks. First, it is necessary to understand the potential impact and the probability of its occurrence. Then checks should be implemented for safety purposes. In general, the higher the potential impact of controls, the lower the probability of an attack. Therefore, the implementation of controls should be given priority..Some manufacturers use ready-made commercial software and hardware in aircraft to reduce costs. According to some sources, this situation poses a safety risk. 
        </p>


    <h3>Main attack vectors:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <b><i>DDOS attack </i></b>- Attackers overwhelmed the servers hosting  sites with garbage requests, making it impossible for travelers to connect and get updates about their scheduled flights or book airport services. <br><br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><i>Ransomware attack</i></b> - Ransomware is a malware designed to deny a user or organization access to files on their computer. By encrypting these files and demanding a ransom payment for the decryption key, cyberattackers place organizations in a position where paying the ransom is the easiest and cheapest way to regain access to their files.  <br><br>
    </li> 
    <li>
        <b><i>Phishing attack</i></b> - Phishing remains one of the most common types of cyber threats across all industries, including aviation. Phishing attacks trick employees into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, by masquerading as a trustworthy person. The potential damage can be enormous, with attackers gaining access to critical systems or sensitive data.  <br><br>
    </li>
    </ul><br>
    <img src="pictures/some_attack.png" style="width:50%"><br><br>
    
    <p><b><i>Motives :</i></b>They went on to say that the industry cyber threats come mainly from Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups that work in collaboration with state actors to steal intellectual property and intelligence, in order to advance their domestic aerospace capabilities as well as possibly monitor, infiltrate and subvert other nations' capabilities. To start, the aviation sector is a critical infrastructure that keeps the world connected. Disruptions in this space can have far-reaching impacts on businesses, economies, and national security.</p>
    

    

    <p>
        <i> In addition, cybercriminals seek out the vast amount of sensitive data including:</i>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            passenger information
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            financial transactions
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            proprietary corporate details 
            <br><br>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Aviationâ€™s digital landscape is a complex ecosystem comprising multiple stakeholders, including airlines, airports, aircraft manufacturers, and a wide array of service providers. This ecosystem is built on a range of technologies, some old and some new, with varying degrees of cybersecurity measures. This diversity can create potential weak points or vulnerabilities that cybercriminals could exploit.
