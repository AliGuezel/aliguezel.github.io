                 The group behind the attack was the pro-Russian hacktivist group named “KillNet”.Later they claimed the attack.Killnet is  known for its DoS (denial of service) and DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks towards government institutions and private companies in several countries during the 2022 Russian invasion on Ukraine.There is no clear idea but the  group is thought to have been formed sometime around March 2022. Mainly they concentrated the attack on countries who supports Ukraine. 
                 killNet claimed the attack and posted 14 target domains on Telegram channel<br><br>
                They have implemented DDoS attack over these 14 airports.A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic. Achieve effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic.<br><br>
