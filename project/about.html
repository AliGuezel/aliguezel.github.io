        The aviation industry is rapidly undergoing digital transformation, with airplanes becoming increasingly digital and reliant on networked components for navigation and communication. Additionally, airports, airlines, aircraft and various subcontractors and service providers handle vast amounts of personal data, including passports and credit card information. While government and organizational security measures are in place, cyber threats continue to evolve, targeting civil aviation operations by attempting to infiltrate the systems of airline companies, airports, and aircraft manufacturers.
        Informatics experts emphasize that a significant portion of companies within the aviation industry remains vulnerable to cyberattacks. Minor errors or oversights may lead to fatality, loss or exposure
        of staff and customers, personally identifiable information, credentials and intellectual properties and intelligence theft. These attacks result in substantial financial losses for the industry annually, making it imperative for companies to develop a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and share information regarding cyber threats. 
        The digitalization of aviation has introduced new vulnerabilities for cybercriminals to exploit, highlighting the aviation sector as a prime target for cyberattacks. The global significance of the aviation industry, impacting both the global economy and security, underscores the international importance of addressing cybersecurity challenges within this sector.
        
        In this report, we will delve deeper into the state of cybersecurity in the aviation industry, exploring the challenges, potential consequences, and strategies for enhancing security measures in this critical sector.
