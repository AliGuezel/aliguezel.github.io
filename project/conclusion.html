    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
   
    <p>
        As the aviation industry continues to embrace digitalization and non-aviation technologies, the cyber threat landscape evolves at an unprecedented pace. The reliance on interconnected systems, the vast amount of sensitive data in circulation, and the increasing sophistication of cyber adversaries all underscore the urgency of robust cybersecurity measures.
        In today's interconnected world, where aviation is not just a means of travel but an integral part of global commerce, ensuring the highest level of cybersecurity is not merely a choice, it is a necessity. Although governments take adequate precautions, providing cyber security should not be left to governments alone. In this sense, all aviation stakeholders, including the public, private sector and non-governmental organizations, need to evaluate their physical and digital security strategies and determine how they will respond to increasing threats. 
        In order to effectively manage cyber risks in terms of aviation management:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Predetermination of cyber risks (Proactive approach),
            </li>
            <li>
                Developing the cyber security workforce,
            </li>
            <li>
                Renewal of old systems,
            </li>
            <li>
                Having an educated and skilled workforce in cyber security
            </li>
            <li>
                Increasing cyber security awareness (Governments and international authorities fulfill their responsibilities),
            </li>
            <li>
                National and international civil aviation organizations to cooperate and share information about cyber threats and cyber attacks,  
            </li>
        </ul>
         <br><br>
