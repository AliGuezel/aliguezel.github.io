        Record-high fuel prices, pressure to improve the passenger experience, evolving regulations, global supply chain disruptions, scheduling challenges, and sustainability concerns are among many factors driving digital transformation in the aviation sector. From advanced navigation and communication systems to maintenance management software to in-flight Wi-Fi connectivity, airlines and airports are modernizing operations to help ensure safe and efficient operation.
        
        Unfortunately, introducing internet connectivity to formerly air-gapped operational technology (OT) introduces cyber risk that may pose a threat to aviation operations. Without a purpose-built cyber-physical systems (CPS) security program in place, organizations in the aviation sector run the risk of operational disruptions due to ransomware, other cyber attacks, or even unintentional user errors. This can manifest in delays and cancellations, leading to lost revenue and reputational damage. Mitigating these risks and, ultimately, gaining cyber and operational resilience requires a new approach that extends far beyond traditional, IT-oriented security solutions. Enter Claroty.

    <h1>Aviation Cyber Security</h1>

    <p>
        Aviation Cyber Security—maintaining safe, secure, and resilient operations—is a top priority for aviation.
        Technology and digitization bring many advantages to aviation, but at the same time, create challenges in managing cyber vulnerabilities in this complex environment. The airline industry is an attractive target for cyber threat actors with a multitude of motivations, ranging from stealing value in data or money to causing disruptions and harm.
        Through leadership and acting now, IATA supports shaping the nature of how the industry responds to cyber security challenges.
